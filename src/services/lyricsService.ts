    `[Verse 1]
I've been thinking about ${title}
The way you make me feel inside
${artist} on my mind day and night
Can't get enough of this feeling so right

[Chorus]
${title}, ${title}
You're all I need, all I see
${title}, oh ${title}
With ${artist} we're meant to be

[Verse 2]
The days go by, but the feeling stays
In my heart, in so many ways
${artist} showed me what it means
To live a life beyond my dreams`,

    `[Intro]
${title} - ${artist}

[Verse]
Walking through the empty streets
Thinking about all that could be
${title} in my head again and again
Wondering if this feeling will ever end

[Chorus]
Oh, ${title}
The way you move me
${artist} knows the truth
We're destined to be

[Bridge]
In the darkness I find light
${artist} by my side, holding tight
${title} is all I see
All I'll ever need`,

    `[Verse 1]
The morning sun breaks through my window
As I think about ${title} once more
${artist} playing on the radio
Taking me back to days before

[Pre-Chorus]
And I wonder if you feel the same
If ${title} still means what it did then
${artist} singing our song

[Chorus]
${title}, sweet ${title}
The memories we made
With ${artist} as our guide
I hope they never fade`
